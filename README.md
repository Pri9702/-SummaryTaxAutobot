# Tax-Autobot
An AI-powered agent that communicates with clients regarding basic tax matters, collects and organizes information requested by tax authorities like SARS, and securely stores the information for accounting purposes.
Background

Problem: Many clients struggle with understanding tax requirements, submitting the correct information to SARS, and keeping their records organized. Accountants spend significant time following up and collecting this data.

Frequency: This is a daily problem for accounting firms handling dozens or hundreds of clients, especially small businesses.

Personal Motivation: As someone working with tax clients, I’ve observed repetitive queries and missing documentation cause delays and stress for both clients and accountants.

Importance/Interest: Streamlining client communication and data collection reduces errors, saves time, and ensures compliance with tax regulations.

Data and AI Techniques

Data Sources:

Client tax records (past submissions, supporting documents)

Information requests from SARS

Chat interactions with clients

Data Quality & Availability:

Structured data (e.g., forms, PDFs, spreadsheets) may require parsing.

Client responses may be incomplete or inconsistent.

AI Techniques:

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding client queries

Chatbot frameworks for automated communication

Document parsing and information extraction

Secure database storage for client data

Demo Idea: A prototype chatbot that can ask a client for missing VAT or payroll information, parse PDF invoices, and store the details in a database.
